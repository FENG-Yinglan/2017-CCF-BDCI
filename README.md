# The-Withdrawal-Risk-Prediction-of-Enterprise-Management
The withdrawal risk prediction of enterprise management can help people realize the shortcomings of current management so that people optimize management strategy of enterprises. With its great theoretical and practical significance, withdrawal risk prediction becomes one of the most attractive research topics in recent years. Based on detailed analysis of behavior information in many aspects of enterprises, we extract a set of meaningful features and train a prediction model using seven tree algorithms. We validate our models by 5-fold cross-validation and then we ensemble all the models using stacking method. The results show that our model makes an accurate prediction of withdrawal risk of enterprise management.
